# IndustrialCam-Trigger

This is a package for triggering and synchronizing industrial cameras by [Point Grey Research](https://www.flir.com/) (now FLIR) in a stereo-setup. Please read this readme carfully before usage.  

In principle every camera that provides a hardware trigger can be used with this package. But, the pin assignments/timings/etc. may vary.

| WARNING: Incorrect pin assignments can cause expensive hardware damage! There is no warranty for nothing at all! |

## Requirements
The below listed hard- and software items are what is required to run everything without changes. For other µCs or not supported camera models some modifications are necessary.

### Hardware
- µC: Arduino nano (ver. 3.0, ATmega 328p) 
- and a socket for it
- Hirose HR10 6-pin female
- Cable: LiFYDY 7x0,1mm<sup>2</sup>
- Rocker switch (if you plan to use the 3D-printed housing, consider [this switch](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/zf-electronics/SRB22A2FBBNN/CH755-ND/446021))
- pushbutton (for the printed housing use a button like [this](https://www.digikey.de/product-detail/de/e-switch/TL1105BF160Q/EG1833-ND/1358))
- female 9-pin sub-d
- male 9-pin sub-d
- good old vga-cable (length depends on you needs)
- 7 LEDs (3mm diameter)
- some prototyping pcb
